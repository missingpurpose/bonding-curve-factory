# Active Context

## Current Focus
The current focus is on implementing a secure and feature-complete free mint alkane contract that follows modern best practices. The implementation is based on the requirements specified in the project brief and aims to address security vulnerabilities present in previous implementations.

## Recent Changes
- **Major Implementation Update**: Completely refactored the MintableAlkane implementation
  - Added MessageDispatch derive macro for better opcode handling
  - Implemented proper initialization guard via observe_initialization()
  - Added transaction hash validation to enforce one mint per transaction
  - Improved error handling with more descriptive messages
  - Enhanced code structure and documentation
- Added serde and serde_json dependencies for transaction hash tracking
- Updated Cargo.toml with better project metadata

## Active Decisions

### Security Implementation
- Using `observe_initialization()` to guard against multiple initializations
- Implementing transaction-based mint limits with hash tracking to prevent abuse
- Adding cap validation to enforce supply constraints
- Using overflow checks for all numeric operations with descriptive error messages

### Storage Design
- Using dedicated storage pointers for each contract property
- Implementing efficient string encoding/decoding for name and symbol
- Storing transaction hashes in a HashSet for mint tracking
- Using serde_json for serialization/deserialization of transaction hash sets

### Interface Design
- Using MessageDispatch derive macro for cleaner opcode handling
- Following the owned token opcode format for consistency
- Adding free mint specific opcodes for additional functionality
- Implementing view functions as no-state-change operations
- Adding comprehensive documentation for all functions

## Next Steps

### Implementation Tasks
1. **Testing**
   - Create comprehensive test suite for all operations
   - Test edge cases for mint limits and cap enforcement
   - Verify compatibility with existing systems
   - Test transaction hash validation

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Review transaction hash storage for efficiency
   - Consider alternative data structures for large-scale usage
   - Optimize serialization/deserialization operations

3. **Documentation**
   - Create usage examples for contract interaction
   - Document security considerations for users
   - Add deployment instructions

### Open Questions
- Should we implement a more sophisticated transaction tracking system for high-volume usage?
- Is there a need for additional access control beyond the initialization guard?
- Should we add a mechanism to update the value per mint after initialization?
