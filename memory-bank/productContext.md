# Product Context

## Purpose
The free_mint.wasm project exists to provide a modernized and secure implementation of a free mint alkane contract. It follows current best practices and security patterns while delivering full functionality of a standard token with free mint capabilities.

## Problem Statement
Previous free mint implementations had security vulnerabilities and lacked proper initialization guards, transaction-based mint limits, and modern alkane patterns. This project addresses these issues by implementing a more secure version with proper guards and constraints.

## User Experience Goals
- Users should be able to easily mint tokens within the defined constraints
- The contract should enforce security measures transparently
- All standard token functionality should be available and compatible with existing systems
- The contract should provide clear analytics on minting activity

## Key Features
1. **Standard Token Functionality**
   - Name, symbol, and total supply tracking
   - Proper initialization sequence with authentication
   - Compatibility with MintableToken trait

2. **Secure Mint Controls**
   - One mint per transaction limit
   - Configurable value per mint
   - Optional maximum supply cap
   - Total mints tracking for analytics

3. **Enhanced Security**
   - Proper initialization guard via observe_initialization()
   - Overflow validation for all numeric operations
   - Cryptographic enforcement of transaction-bound mint limits
   - Cap constraint validation before any mint operation

## Stakeholders
- Token creators who need a secure free mint implementation
- Users who will interact with the token contract
- Developers integrating with the token contract
- Security auditors verifying the implementation
